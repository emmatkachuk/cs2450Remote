They typically include a business context, problem statement, and scope included in the document. This week, we will be creating our own YouFace project requirements and formulating user stories.

Date: 9.17.25 - This week in class we are learning about diagrams such as flow and component diagrams. We also have been working more with user stories. In addition, I learned about pull requests and how we should never approve the merges ourselves, but rather have a teammate review the work first and then merge.

Date: 9.22.25 - This week we are talking about and pitching our projects. We will be creating a PowerPoint presentation giving our class an idea of what we will be implementing. We should be becoming more familiar with our YouFace template layout and how we will be changing it to implement our own design.
