Date: 8.25.25 - Subject: What I learned today. I set up my SSH keys today and created some new repositories. I will also be keeping track of my progress in an engineering journal.

Date: 9.3.25 - Subject: Today's lesson. We worked in a team to learn how to collaborate on ideas for our youface project. We will also be learning about Flask this week and taking a look at our starter code for the project.

Date: 9.8.25 - In class today, we talked about project requirements and how the documents look and work. They typically include a business context, problem statement, and scope included in the document. This week, we will be creating our own YouFace project requirements and formulating user stories.

Date: 9.17.25 - This week in class we are learning about diagrams such as flow and component diagrams. We also have been working more with user stories. In addition, I learned about pull requests and how we should never approve the merges ourselves, but rather have a teammate review the work first and then merge.

Date: 9.22.25 - This week we are talking about and pitching our projects. We will be creating a PowerPoint presentation giving our class an idea of what we will be implementing. We should be becoming more familiar with our YouFace template layout and how we will be changing it to implement our own design.

Date: 9.24.25 - Today we had to fix our flow diagrams to represent the different types of flow that our cites will have. I worked on the add or remove a user flow which was fairly simple. I then have to push that to our team repository and upload it as a pdf. We will be referencing these diagrams as we work towards our project goal.

Date: 9.29.25 - Today in class we got to view other groups project pitch and see how each are going to implement their work. The mySpy team was also able to present their project pitch and explain to the audience how we will succeed in building and implementing it.

Date: 10.3.25 - We went through all the project pitch presentations. I was actually surprised as many teams made their slides really customized to their project theme which was really cool to see. Today we are taking a look at Kanban boards and creating them for our own projects where team members can claim issues and check them in as we are working on them.

Date: 10.6.25 - This week we are talking about how this class will help us in the future. The processes and everything we are learning with the tech and collaboration with our team. All of this knowledge will help us better our position in the tech industry. We will be doing a pair programming and scrum master assignments this week.

Date: 10.8.25 - Today we talked about pair programming and how we can colaborate on one program with two people to work together and solve the issue together rather than individually completing it and having someone check it.
